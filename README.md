# GitHub_Practice_Skeleton
I taught an introductory OOP course to an A-Level class at Wimbledon High School. As part of this course, I gave a lesson on how to use GitHub for version control and collaboration to support them with their assessed individual project in year 13. This repository provides skeleton code and a specification sheet for a mini project I designed with these objectives in mind. Details of the full course can be found on my [personal website](http://www.ameliakhavari.com/).
